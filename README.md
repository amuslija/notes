# notes.

A simple CRUD-like React web applicaiton that embodies the basic principles of React Apps. It was created as part of a training session focused on mastering data-management in React and tackling number of frontend principles

  - View design in React
  - Data management using React-Redux
  - Page management with React-Router
  - Back end scaffolded using Firebase
  - Initial contact with Sassy CSS

The project itself was created using [react-create-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and corresponding `react-scripts` have been modified in order to accomodate styles contaiend in `sccs` files.

### Installation

`npm` is needed for installing application dependencies. Besides that, the application should run out of the box:

```
    git clone https://github.com/amuslija/notes
    cd notes
    npm install
    npm start
```

### Todo

- [ ] Switch from Firebase to custom backend
- [ ] Implement new user creation
- [ ] Change style to (Bootstrap) grid
- [ ] Create a production ready app
